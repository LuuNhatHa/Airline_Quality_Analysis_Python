# Airline_Quality_Analysis_Python
Analyzed and visualized airline quality data using Python to uncover key performance trends and customer service insights across major U.S. airlines.

# Project Objectives
- Clean and explore the U.S. Airline Quality Ratings dataset.
- Analyze metrics such as total delay time and average customer satisfaction point (scale 1–5).
- Visualize patterns and trends using statistical and advanced plots.
- Identify performance highlights and weaknesses across different airlines over time.

# Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy) – For data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn – For creating insightful statistical and comparative visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook – For interactive development and presenting results.

# Dataset
Source: Airline Quality Ratings Dataset – Kaggle
Dataset Details: The dataset contains feedback from over 120,000 airline passengers, capturing detailed information about each traveler, their flight characteristics, and their satisfaction levels. It includes both demographic and behavioral data, along with ratings on various service aspects such as cleanliness, comfort, and overall experience.
Columns Include:
- Passenger Info: ID, Gender, Age, Customer Type, Type of Travel, Class
- Flight Details: Flight Distance, Departure Delay, Arrival Delay
- Service Ratings:
Pre-flight: Departure & Arrival Time Convenience, Ease of Online Booking, Check-in Service, Online Boarding, Gate Location
In-flight: On-board Service, Seat Comfort, Leg Room Service, Cleanliness, Food and Drink, In-flight Service, In-flight Wifi Service, In-flight Entertainment
Post-flight: Baggage Handling
Overall Rating: Satisfaction.

# Outcome
- The dataset was fully cleaned and processed ( missing value handling, column standardization,...).
- Descriptive statistical analysis was performed across all quality indicators.
- Visualizations were built to explore distribution, trends, and correlations among metrics.
- Effective and underperforming services were clearly identified to support targeted improvements.

# Key Insights Presented
- Are passengers satisfied with their flights? What rating score (on a 1–5 scale) do they give most frequently?
- Which customer profiles tend to give stricter evaluations and have higher service expectations?
- What types of flights or travel conditions are associated with lower service ratings?
- Which service factors have the strongest influence on the overall satisfaction score?
- Which areas of service need the most improvement based on passenger feedback?
